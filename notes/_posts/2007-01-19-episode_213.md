**10:13** - Zoro refers to Sanji's eyebrow as a coil of mosquito repellent.

In Japan, the most common form of mosquito repellent (ka-tori senkou - literally "mosquito-removal incense") is a long coil which is burned and emits chemicals which deter and repel the little buggers.

The repellent was made of packed dried grass (giving them a brown color) and chemicals taken from Pyrethrums, of the Chrysanthemum family, which were imported from the US in 1885.  The coil model appeared ten years later, in 1895.

Modern coils are green in color and use synthetic chemicals called pyrethroids to protect your picnic.
